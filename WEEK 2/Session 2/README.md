## Session Details
**Course:** Tools in Data Science (TDS)  
**Session:** Week 2 – Session 2  
**Mode:** Recorded Online Session  
**Focus Area:** Podman vs Docker, GitHub Pages, FastAPI, Vercel deployment, and ngrok  

---

## Session Overview
The session explored differences between containers and virtual machines, compared Podman and Docker, and introduced deployment workflows. It included building and testing APIs using FastAPI, deploying static websites with GitHub Pages, hosting applications on Vercel, and exposing local development servers using ngrok. Concepts such as HTTP methods, environment variables, and CORS were also discussed.
