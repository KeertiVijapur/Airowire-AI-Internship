## Session Details
**Course:** Tools in Data Science (TDS)  
**Session:** Week 3 – Session 2  
**Mode:** Recorded Online Session
(https://youtu.be/oWAaWzmOwmM)

**Focus Area:** Embeddings, vector databases, chunking, and semantic search

---

## Session Overview
This session built upon theoretical LLM concepts and moved into implementation. It demonstrated how text is converted into embeddings, stored in vector databases, and retrieved using similarity search. The session also covered chunking large documents, handling API interactions, and building a question-answering workflow using embeddings.

---

## Topics Covered

### Embeddings
Understanding how text is transformed into vector representations that capture semantic meaning.

---

### Multimodal Embeddings
Working with embeddings generated from different types of data such as text and images.

---

### Vector Databases
Storing and retrieving embeddings efficiently using similarity search techniques.

---

### Chunking
Breaking large documents into smaller pieces for better retrieval performance.

---

### Asking Questions using Embeddings
Retrieving the most relevant chunks based on similarity scoring and generating answers.

---

### Similarity Metrics
Using cosine similarity, dot product, and normalization for comparing vectors.

---

### API Interaction & JSON Handling
Using API keys, handling JSON responses, and performing asynchronous requests.
